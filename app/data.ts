    ABOUT_ME: `
        I'm Panagiotis Kontoeidis, a passionate Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development and backend systems. 
        I recently earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Athens, and after completing my military service, 
        I'm eager to dive into the world of professional software development. 
        
        With hands-on experience at Kotsovolos and Logicea, Iâ€™ve worked on scalable web applications using React.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL. 
        Beyond coding, I am a Greek National Team fencer, bringing resilience, teamwork, and a problem-solving mindset to every project I work on.
